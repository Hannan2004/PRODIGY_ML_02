# Customer Segmentation with K-means Clustering

This repository contains the implementation of a customer segmentation task using the K-means clustering algorithm. The project was completed as part of Task-2 during my Machine Learning internship at Prodigy InfoTech.

## Task Overview

The objective of the task was to group customers of a retail store based on their purchase history. The K-means clustering algorithm was employed to achieve segmentation, providing insights into customer behavior and preferences.

## Key Learnings

- Understanding of the K-means clustering algorithm.
- Determining the optimal number of clusters using the elbow point method.
- Exploring industrial applications of K-means clustering in retail stores, banks, and insurance companies.

## Dataset

The segmentation was performed on customer data, focusing on their annual salary.

## Project Structure

- `mallCustomerSegmentation.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the implementation of the K-means clustering algorithm.
- `Mall_Customers.csv`: contains the dataset used for the analysis.
- `README.md`: Project documentation.

## How to Use

1. Open the `mallCustomerSegmentation.ipynb` notebook to view the implementation details.
2. Install the required dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt` (if applicable).
3. Run the notebook to perform the clustering analysis.
